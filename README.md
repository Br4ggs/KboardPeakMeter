# About ChromaProject
Windows Core Api visualisation using Razer Chroma written in C#.

I started this project mostly to get more familiar with a couple of things:

* Using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) with C#
* Working with DLL and COM in C#
* Working with more hardware related API's (This project uses the Colore API for controlling the lights on Chroma keyboards)
